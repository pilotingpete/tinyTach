/** @file
 * Tiny Tach uses a single 4 character bubble display, the QDSP 6064.
 * The Display is driven thru a shift register for the segments
 * and GPIO for the cathodes. The display is multiplexed @ ~256Hz
 * The bubble display has 4 cathodes, one for each digit. The 
 * cathodes are connected to the uC pins and configured to sink current.
 * Set the the corresponding uC pin LOW to select a cathode to 
 * sink current and display data. 
 * Set the uC pin HIGH to deselect a cathode.
